Hello, my name is Bella Genolio, welcome to my github!
Here you can find a handful of the projects from my time as a Statistics and Data Science student
at University of California, Santa Barbara.
In my files you can see:
- a machine learning project that utlizes multiple models to predict the price of tips at a restaurant
- an analytical look into the interaction between blue whales and dungeness crab fisheries off of the coast of California
- an estimate for future temperatures in Yokohama using time series methodology
- an investigation into the relationship between infant mortality and medicaid
